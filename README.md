## About this project

Country Finder is a web-based application which allow users to do searches related to countries. Basically, there are two ways of using the app: by doing a Simple Search, where the name of a country of interest can be typed; or by doing an Advanced Search, where it is possible to define certain parameters to make a more customized search.

This project is a final project for CS50, Harvard University's introduction to computer science.
